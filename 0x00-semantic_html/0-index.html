        <h1>Girls' education</h1>

          <h2>Gender equality in education benefits every child.</h2>
          <p>
            Investing in girls’ education transforms communities, countries and
            the entire world. Girls who receive an education are less likely to
            marry young and more likely to lead healthy, productive lives. They
            earn higher incomes, participate in the decisions that most affect
            them, and build better futures for themselves and their families.
            Girls’ education strengthens economies and reduces inequality. It
            contributes to more stable, resilient societies that give all
            individuals – including boys and men – the opportunity to fulfil
            their potential. But education for girls is about more than access
            to school. It’s also about girls feeling safe in classrooms and
            supported in the subjects and careers they choose to pursue –
            including those in which they are often under-represented.
